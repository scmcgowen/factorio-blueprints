# Herr Katze's Factorio Blueprints
Blueprints are sorted by Factorio version then whether they're modded or vanilla.  
for instance a blueprint for Factorio 2.0 vanilla will be in `2.0/vanilla` or a blueprint for 2.0 Space Age would be in `2.0/space_age/`  
> [!NOTE]
> Factorio version is based on the version I create the blueprint in.
